# Duo Token API

Node/TypeScript backend for the Flutter + LiveKit walkie-talkie app.

Phase 0 includes only the backend scaffold and a health endpoint. LiveKit token generation, Firebase Admin verification, FCM sends, group APIs, and nudge APIs are implemented in later phases.

Phase 2 adds Firebase Admin, LiveKit token, FCM utility, readiness, and Docker scaffolding.
Phase 4/5 add group/invite APIs and the authenticated LiveKit token endpoint.
Phase 6/7 add friend-live/nudge notification endpoints. Push-to-talk locking is currently client/Firebase-owned.

## Run Locally

Use Node 20-24. If this machine routes `npm` through a broken Homebrew Node install, initialize `fnm` first:

```sh
eval "$(fnm env --shell zsh)"
fnm use 20.19.4
```

```sh
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Health check:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

Readiness check:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/readyz
```

## Current API Surface

Authenticated app endpoints under `/v1/*` require:

```txt
Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>
```

The internal job endpoint below uses `INTERNAL_JOB_SECRET` instead of a Firebase ID token.

Endpoints:

```txt
POST /v1/groups
GET  /v1/groups
GET  /v1/groups/:groupId/members
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/invites
DELETE /v1/groups/:groupId/members/:memberUserId
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/leave
DELETE /v1/groups/:groupId
POST /v1/invites/join
GET  /invite/:inviteCode
GET  /.well-known/assetlinks.json
POST /v1/livekit/token
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/notifications/friend-live
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/nudges
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/ring-nudges
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/voice-nudges/uploads
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/voice-nudges/:eventId/complete
POST /v1/groups/:groupId/voice-nudges
GET  /v1/voice-nudges/:eventId/audio
POST /v1/voice-nudges/:eventId/ack
POST /v1/subscriptions/redeem
POST /v1/internal/jobs/no-group-reminders
```

`POST /v1/internal/jobs/no-group-reminders` is authenticated with
`INTERNAL_JOB_SECRET` (`Authorization: Bearer …` or `X-Internal-Job-Secret`).
It sends create-group reminder pushes to logged-in new users (≤14 days old)
who still have no groups and have not opened the app for ≥1 day, up to 3
daily reminders. Tap opens the app via the standard FCM notification click.
You can also run `npm run no-group-reminders` on a host with Firebase Admin
credentials.


Voice nudges use signed URLs end to end:

1. `POST .../voice-nudges/uploads` (JSON: `targetScope`, optional
   `targetUserId`, `durationMs`) returns a short-lived Cloud Storage V4
   **write** URL plus required headers. The client PUTs `audio/mp4` (≤96 KiB)
   directly to Storage — raw audio never enters the API process.
2. `POST .../voice-nudges/:eventId/complete` verifies the object (size + M4A
   header only), mints a V4 **read** URL, and dispatches FCM.
3. Legacy `POST .../voice-nudges` still accepts an authenticated `audio/mp4`
   body for older clients; prefer the uploads/complete flow.

FCM delivers a short-lived Cloud Storage signed `audioUrl` so recipients
download audio directly from Storage (no backend audio proxy).
`GET /v1/voice-nudges/:eventId/audio` remains as a compatibility redirect
(302) to a fresh signed URL for older clients. Acknowledgement requests are
authorized by the short-lived per-device token delivered through FCM; they
do not use Firebase Auth because they must work before Flutter starts.

Set `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` and `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in production. Add a
Cloud Storage lifecycle rule that removes objects under `voiceNudges/` after
one day as a final safety net; normal cleanup happens immediately after every
recipient has played the nudge.

`/v1/subscriptions/redeem` validates an internal developer code against the
SHA-256 hashes in `SUBSCRIPTION_REDEEM_CODE_HASHES`, then grants the authenticated
Firebase user the `oneOneDeveloper` access claim. Plaintext codes must never be
stored in the repository or deployment environment.

Group invite creation returns both `inviteCode` and `inviteUrl`. Configure
`PUBLIC_INVITE_BASE_URL` with the public HTTPS `/invite` base and
`ANDROID_APP_LINK_SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINTS` with comma-separated Play/internal
SHA-256 signing fingerprints. The public invite endpoint redirects to the
installed Android app as a fallback; `assetlinks.json` enables direct verified
App Link opening.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

## Environment

Do not commit real secrets. Keep local values in `.env`; deployment values should come from VM/container secrets.

After Phase 2/4/5 changes, run `npm install` once so `package-lock.json` includes the new backend dependencies.
